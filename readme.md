## ElevenLabs Traffic Report Demo

This was a fun little distraction I whipped up based on a video found on Discord as a proof-of-concept.

## Installation:

This script uses the ```python-dotenv```, ```feedparser```, and ```elevenlabs``` packages from pip.

```elevenlabs``` requires [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) to play the audio.

### N.B.

This code comes with no warranties, gaurantees, graphic tees, peach teas, or any other nonsense. It is what it is. I don't anticipate actually maintaining this, and am only uploading it because it was fun.
